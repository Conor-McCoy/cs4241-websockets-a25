Description

This application is a live competitive/interactive game for users to compete with each other. Each user can set the color that they represent, then can click on the tiles featured on the website to change them to their own color. The "board" updates live for all users, allowing them to compete for ownership of the area, and allowing users to overwrite other players color placements.
